# Reading and Processing Different File Formats Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will practice reading and processing data from different file formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML. This is a fundamental skill for any data analyst.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find three function definitions: `read_csv_file(file_path)`, `read_json_file(file_path)`, and `read_xml_file(file_path)`.
3.  Your task is to implement these functions to read the corresponding file formats and return a Pandas DataFrame.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How would you handle errors when reading files, such as a file not found error?
*   Explore other file formats that are commonly used in data analysis, such as Parquet or Feather.
*   How can you write data to these different file formats using Pandas?
